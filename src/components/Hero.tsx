        <p>
          I'm a passionate web developer who loves turning ideas into
          functional, user-friendly applications. From crafting sleek weather
          apps to automating LeetCode-to-GitHub workflows, I enjoy building
          tools that make life easier. Recently, I developed Leet2Git, a tool
          that transforms LeetCode problems into well-structured GitHub
          repositories, andGet-My-Attendance, a WiFi-based attendance system. I
          also won the Best About Us Page Award in a web design competition and
          ranked Top 5 in a college hackathon. Currently, I'm sharpening my web
          development skills while gearing up to explore AI. ðŸš€
